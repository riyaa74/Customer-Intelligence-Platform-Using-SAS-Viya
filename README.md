# Customer Intelligence Platform Using SAS Viya

In this paper, we apply a repeatable model of text analytics and machine learning techniques to the publicly available Prudential Life Insurance dataset, automobile insurance dataset and CFPB  data. 
Specifically, we use SAS® VIYA: Visual analytics, Visual statistics, Build Models, and Visual Text Analysis to explore trend, patterns, sentiment, and machine learning techniques to generate predictive models and model the natural language available in each free-form complaint against a disposition code for the complaint. We also explore methods to structure and visualize the results, showcasing how areas of concern are made available to analysts using SAS® Visual Analytics and SAS® Visual Statistics. Finally, we discuss the applications of this methodology for overseeing financial institutions. 
To generate insights, build model, test & validate the team has followed scientific methodology of developing the hypothesis and trying to disprove the same using various testing scenarios. To develop other components such as dashboards, reports, DDC objects, web app, mobile app & various integration teams has followed an agile approach by dividing the project into work streams and further achieving the milestone in a smaller sprint cycle.
